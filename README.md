May 31 2024: Final English poster is now online!!!!
The LaTeX is still up to date, but we couldn't make a nice poster with code alone.  CANSSI Ontario provided design work.  The Enlish poster is [here](https://github.com/iamdavecampbell/Canadian_Women_in_Statistics/blob/main/Firsts%20for%20Women%20in%20Statistics%20Poster%20%2036%20by%2075%20inches.pdf), 
download the poster to view as might not render in the online Github.

French copy requires considerable hands on work and is ongoing.

# Firsts for Women in Statistics in Canada 

## Description
The Statistical Society of Canada fundraising committee and the Faculty of Science at Carleton University have contributed funds towards producing a poster highlighting firsts for women in statistics in Canada. This project aims to provide an open source poster highlighting removal of legislative barriers and firsts for women[^1] in statistics in Canada.

[^1]: Notes on choice of Women
Even though using a binary definition of gender is out of date, more general diversity was an initial direction of interest, but the journalistic complexity would have slowed the project considerably. The poster is meant to be adaptable and modifiable for future work, including to more general definitions of diversity. The project and its focus on women is largely motivated by excellent reads such as: <br/><br/> Billard, L. And Kafadar, K. (2015) “Women in Statistics: Scientific Contributions Versus Rewards“ in ‘Advancing Women in Science: An International Perspective’, W. Pearson, Jr., et al. (eds.), DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-08629-3_7 <br/><br/> Thomson, M (2014) “Reflections on Women in Statistics in Canada”, in ‘Past, Present, and Future of Statistical Science’ X. Lin et al (eds.) DOI 10.1201/b16720 <br/><br/> Stinnett, S (1990) "Women in Statistics: Sesquicentennial Activities” The American Statistician, Vol 44, No 2, pp 74-80

To improve the long term utility, the poster is under GNU GPL v3 so that it can be freely printed, updated, and modified to include regionally important events, names, milestones, or shift towards other diversity questions.

## Notes:
- Some groups, such as the American Statistical Association do not have a formal translation of name so these are left in English in the French poster.  This is consistent with the practice in SSC Liaison.
